# Casting agency doc

Casting agency api is a tool that provides endpoints to support you create an application to manage casting.

I developed this project to make use of the knowledge I acquired in Udacity nanogree and hence gain confidence in these skills.

## Login
https://thanhphamtrung.jp.auth0.com/authorize?
  audience=agency&
  response_type=token&
  client_id=AT1aiWyL9ncM3dH6VFtVTlJqWCgHEL8k&
  redirect_uri=https://127.0.0.1:8080/login-results

The access token will be displayed on the URL bar after login.

## THIRD-PARTY AUTHENTICATION
### RABC
- There are 3 roles 'Casting Assistant', 'Casting Director' and 'Executive Producer'.
- To get access token for 'Casting Assistant', login with account:
    - username: castingassistant377@gmail.com
    - password: Thanh123#
- To get access token for 'Casting Director', login with account:
    - username: castingdirector174@gmail.com
    - password: Thanh123#
- To get access token for 'Executive Producer', login with account:
    - username: executiveproducer90@gmail.com
    - password: Thanh123#

### auth.py
Auth0 is set up and running. The following configurations are in a setup.sh file which is exported by the app:
- The Auth0 Domain Name
- The JWT code signing secret
- The Auth0 Client ID
The JWT token contains the permissions for the 'Executive Producer' roles.

## DATA MODELING:
### models.py
The schema for the database and helper methods to simplify API behavior are in models.py:
- There are three tables created: Movie, Acotr and Casting
- The Movie table is used by the role 'Executive Producer' to add, update and create movies. 'Casting Director' and 'Casting Assistant' can retrieve movie list.
- The Actor table is used by the role 'Executive Producer' and 'Casting Director' to add, update and create actors. 'Casting Assistant' can retrieve actor list.
- The Casting table is used by the role 'Executive Producer', 'Casting Director' and 'Casting Assistant' to add, update and create castings and retrive all casting data
- The Casting table has 2 foreign keys 'actor_id' and 'movie_id' for both Actor and Movie table.
Each table has an insert, update, delete, and format helper functions.

## Run and Test local
1. Run venv

    ```
    python3.9 -m venv venv
    ```

2. Setup environment

    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    source setup.sh
    ```

3. Install dependencies
    
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a new database and import new data for testing
    
    ```
    dropdb agency # (optional) Drop if it exists 
    createdb agency
    psql -U postgres -d agency < database.sql
    ```

5. Run the app

    ```
    flask run -p 3000
    ```


6. Login in local

    <a href="https://fsnd-stu.us.auth0.com/authorize?audience=casting-agency&response_type=token&client_id=2NqLLf0o0DJrhgYUOhbSWHttGWPaM7gI&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/">Login locally</a>
    The access token will be displayed on the URL bar after login.

7. Run unittest
   ```
   python3 test_flask.py
   ```

8. Run test

    In Postman, import file **casting-agency.postman_collection.json** to run the test.

    If the tokens expire, please login locally again to get the token for respectively roles.
